Persistent Segment Tree Since persistent arrays with path copying are so similar to sparse segment trees, it's relatively straightforward to convert one into a persistent segment tree - just add range queries!\n",
      "Resources Solution Since this problem involves range queries, we'll use some type of segment tree to solve it. (We can also use a Fenwick tree, but that's much harder to make persistent.) When dealing with problems involving multiple dimensions, it's often helpful to view one of those dimensions as time. In this problem, we'll view the index of each array as its time dimension. Using a persistent segment tree, we can then turn the problem into the following: Type 1 queries involve a point update on the segment tree at some time. Type 2 queries involve a range query on the segment tree at some time. Type 3 queries involve copying the root of the segment tree at some time and appending it to the array of segment tree roots.\n",

Let our array be $a$, and the prefix sum array of $a$ be $b$. If we add $x$ to the range $[p, n]$, then, for every $i \\geq p$, we add $x \\cdot (i - p + 1)$ to each $b_i$ in the range. To query the prefix of $[1, p]$, we can consider the following process: Find the sum of all the range additions affecting the index $p$.\n",

Insert can be done with one split and two merges: We split the array between the index we want to insert, create a new node with the corresponding value, and merge the three sections together. Delete can be done with two splits and one merge: We split the array into three parts before and after the index, and merge the two parts together.\n",
      "Range queries can be performed by maintaining additional data in each node. We update this data whenever we update $\\texttt{size}$. Range updates can be performed by maintaining a lazy tag in each node (as in lazy propagation). When splitting or merging, we push these tags downwards and perform the corresponding operation. Range reversals can be performed by maintaining a lazy reversed tag in each node. When splitting or merging, we first swap the node's left and right children, then push the tag down.\n",

Note that each update operation runs in $\\mathcal{\\Omega}(\\log n)$, so if there are no point updates, then the time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log a \\log n)$. Each point update increases the entropy by a fixed amount $\\lceil \\log a \\rceil$. If there are $q_p$ point updates, then the total entropy over all updates is bounded by $n \\log a + q_p \\log a$.
