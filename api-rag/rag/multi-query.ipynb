In a normal segment tree, an update only affects $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log N)$ nodes, so in a sparse segment tree, we only store $\\\\mathcal{O}(Q \\\\log N)$ nodes! We can implement this efficiently using pointers to a node's children - just like a trie! (Then again, a segment tree is basically a fancier binary trie.)

      "* Q: Do I need to participate in the USACO December contest before participating in the other contests? No. Q: How are USACO contests scored? USACO contests are scored out of $1000$ points. Each problem is worth $1000/3 = 333.333 \\dots$ points. When a solution to a problem is submitted, it is run against a number of test cases (see the second link above for details). All test cases for a problem (typically 10-30) are weighted equally, except the sample test case(s), which do not count toward your score. Inputs and outputs for test cases other than the sample test cases are not visible during the contest. For example, Cow College has 1 sample test case (test case 1) and 11 non-sample test cases (test cases 2-12). For each of test cases 2-12 you get correct, you earn $333.333 \\dots/11 = 30.3030\\dots$ points. Q: Does passing all the test cases guarantee that my solution is correct? No, it is entirely possible that there is a test case for which your solution fails. In the extremely rare case that test cases are added after the end of the contest, solutions that previously received full credit often fail to receive full credit afterward. In general, it is extremely difficult to check that your solution is correct with 100% certainty, but one way to check that there isn't anything obviously wrong with your solution is to stress test against a model solution.

Best of luck on your competitive programming journey!\", 'prechunk': 'Q: What are the constraints on memory and time for C++, Python, and Java programs? In USACO contests, programs written in various programming languages are subject to specific constraints to ensure fair and efficient competition. These constraints include both time limits and memory allocations, which vary slightly depending on the language used. Time Constraints: Each input test case is allotted a specific time limit for program execution. This time limit typically ranges around 4 seconds, although it can vary depending on the complexity of the problem and the specific contest. Within this time frame, the program must complete its execution and produce the correct output. Exceeding the time limit results in the program being terminated, leading to a verdict of \"Time Limit Exceeded\". Memory Constraints: Programs are allocated a certain amount of memory for their execution. The allocated memory is used to store variables, data structures, and other program-related information during execution. It\\'s essential for participants to manage memory efficiently to avoid exceeding the allocated memory limit, which would lead to a \"Memory Limit Exceeded\" verdict. Here\\'s a table summarizing the constraints for different programming languages in USACO contests: | Programming Language | Time Limit | Memory Allocation | |----------------------|--------------|-------------------| | Java | Around 4 sec | Around 256 MB | | C++ | Around 2 sec | Around 256 MB | | Python | Around 4 sec | Around 256 MB |', 'title': 'USACO_FAQs'}]\n",

Then each iteration of the binary search cuts the search space in half, so the algorithm tests $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log N)$ values. This is efficient and much better than testing each possible value in the search space. Binary Search on Monotonic Functions Let's say we have a boolean function f(x). Usually, in such problems, we want to find the maximum or minimum value of $x$ such that f(x) is true. Similarly to how binary search on an array only works on a sorted array, binary search on the answer only works if the answer function is monotonic, meaning that it is always non-decreasing or always non-increasing. Finding The Maximum x Such That f(x) = true We want to construct a function lastTrue such that lastTrue(lo, hi, f) returns the last x in the range [lo,hi] such that f(x) = true. If no such x exists, then lastTrue should return lo-1. This can be done with binary search if f(x) satisfies both of the following conditions: If f(x) = true, then f(y) = true for all $y \\\\leq x$. If f(x) = false, then f(y) = false for all $y \\\\geq x$. For example, if f(x) is given by the following function: f(1) = true f(2) = true f(3) = true f(4) = true f(5) = true f(6) = false f(7) = false f(8) = false then lastTrue(1, 8, f) = 5 and lastTrue(7, 8, f) = 6.\", 'prechunk': '', 'title': 'Binary_Search'}]\n",

Best of luck on your competitive programming journey!\", 'prechunk': 'Q: What are the constraints on memory and time for C++, Python, and Java programs? In USACO contests, programs written in various programming languages are subject to specific constraints to ensure fair and efficient competition. These constraints include both time limits and memory allocations, which vary slightly depending on the language used. Time Constraints: Each input test case is allotted a specific time limit for program execution. This time limit typically ranges around 4 seconds, although it can vary depending on the complexity of the problem and the specific contest. Within this time frame, the program must complete its execution and produce the correct output. Exceeding the time limit results in the program being terminated, leading to a verdict of \"Time Limit Exceeded\". Memory Constraints: Programs are allocated a certain amount of memory for their execution. The allocated memory is used to store variables, data structures, and other program-related information during execution. It\\'s essential for participants to manage memory efficiently to avoid exceeding the allocated memory limit, which would lead to a \"Memory Limit Exceeded\" verdict. Here\\'s a table summarizing the constraints for different programming languages in USACO contests: | Programming Language | Time Limit | Memory Allocation | |----------------------|--------------|-------------------| | Java | Around 4 sec | Around 256 MB | | C++ | Around 2 sec | Around 256 MB | | Python | Around 4 sec | Around 256 MB |', 'title': 'USACO_FAQs'}]\n",
